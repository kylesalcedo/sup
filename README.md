# GitHub Activity Pattern Generator - "H" Test

This repository demonstrates a small test of the GitHub contribution graph pattern generator. It shows just the letter "H" as a proof of concept.

## How it works

The pattern is created by making commits with specifically dated timestamps to create a visual pattern on GitHub's contribution graph.

## When will it be visible?

The pattern will be visible on my GitHub contribution graph starting from December 2024 through January 2025.

## Full pattern repository
